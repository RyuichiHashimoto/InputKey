*I'm sorry, japanese comments is writtein in this source code.
So, you should erase these comments before running the program.

#### 4. How to create the input file

##### 4.1 Need to write specific character strings.

　For avoiding usage of an unexpected file, it cannot be executed unless there are specific character strings on the first and last lines of the file..

- first line of an input file:  ##############start##############
- last line of an input file: ##############finish##############

##### 4.2 comment out

Same as the Python, Comments of the input file begin with a hash mark ( # ) and whitespace character and continue to the end of the line.

##### 4.3 special character (ctrl, alt)

Alphabet, number: As it is

Special key (Ctrl, alt, Shift): input the key name inside the [] (e.g., [Shift], [ctrl])

Alphabet or number while pressing a specific special button: write such as [shift, abc]
